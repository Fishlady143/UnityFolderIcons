# UnityFolderIcons
A simple scriptable object system that allows you to create and change folder icon, containing a few examples

!!Don't change the folders name or location, as it will break!!

You will need to make your own unique icons, but there is a blank template in ``FolderIcons/Icons/Default``

Using the create menu, create a ``FolderScriptableObject``.
The texture and base name applied to the ``FolderObject`` if it's named the same thing as texture.
Otherwise it will log a warning telling you to assign one manually.
